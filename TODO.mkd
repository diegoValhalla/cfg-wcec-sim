* Find and keep edges from a CFG path where its WCEC is less than the worst and
  greater than the best
* Do the simulation in all CFG paths by applying Valentin's idea of optimum
  frequencies and Korean's idea to change intra-task frequency. Output the
  following informations:
    - finished time;
    - total of cycles consumed;
    - total of energy spent;
    - used frequencies in order of appearance;
    - cycles consumed, time and energy spent by each frequency.
